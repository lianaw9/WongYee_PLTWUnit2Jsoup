AbbyV, The colors on this scarf are perfect, and it‚Äôs generally well-made, soft and a good size. It‚Äôs also warm without being too heavy. My only complaint is that it sheds. I wear contacts and the little fibers stuck to my lenses and irritated my eyes, making them red and itchy. ALSO, my wardrobe is primarily black and this scarf made me look like I live with 20 dogs. I did wear it several times but unfortunately won‚Äôt wear it anymore., 4, January 25 2024
NM, Love this scarf! Soft and warm!, 5, November 29 2024
Crystal, I love the scarf. It is exactly what I wanted. The colors are perfect. üòç The shape perfect length too. The only thing I suggest is that it should be put in a weather proof packaging. It came in a plastic bag with holes I am not always here to get right away. If the weather was bad before I could get it that would have been really bad. Thanks for listening. üëÇ, 5, December 5 2024

speedyjeans, I love this scarf it's soooo soft :))) I grew up in a warm climate and moved to a cold climate to attend college, and this has kept me warm and cozy all winter!

m. jones, It‚Äôs pretty, soft and large; will keep you warm. Only down side is the info said don‚Äôt dry clean or use bleach, so I assumed that I could machine wash it, especially as it‚Äôs made of acrylic. Found out it has to be hand washed and drip dried. That should have been plainly written on the info page., 4, December 26 2022

Real reviewer, I bought pattern C9. The scarf is soft, designed with beautiful muted, neutral and will go with many colors. I only had one area where a thread was woven incorrectly. It‚Äôs not a deal breaker. This feels and looks like an expensive scarf. I‚Äôm buying another one since the price dropped by $2 because I want a back up scarf so that I can enjoy them for years to come., 5, February 25 2021

April Nunn, I love scarves and have worn those to work for a nice layered look and to help nicely coordinate colors in my outfit . Love it!, 5, March 20 2023
Rebecca Pinard, This scarf is SO soft people have asked me where I got AND how expensive was it. Amazing for the price!!! It leaves lint on black pants so hopefully after a wash it will retain its softness. The lint is minimal and NOT a big deal so I‚Äôm going to try and gentle wash it:), 5, January 1 2022
