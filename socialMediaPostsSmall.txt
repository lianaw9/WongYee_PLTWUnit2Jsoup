AbbyV, "The colors on this scarf are perfect, and it‚Äôs generally well-made, soft and a good size. It‚Äôs also warm without being too heavy. My only complaint is that it sheds. I wear contacts and the little fibers stuck to my lenses and irritated my eyes, making them red and itchy. ALSO, my wardrobe is primarily black and this scarf made me look like I live with 20 dogs. I did wear it several times but unfortunately won‚Äôt wear it anymore.", 4, January 25 2024

Crystal, "I love the scarf. It is exactly what I wanted. The colors are perfect. üòç The shape perfect length too. The only thing I suggest is that it should be put in a weather proof packaging. It came in a plastic bag with holes I am not always here to get right away. If the weather was bad before I could get it that would have been really bad. Thanks for listening. üëÇ", 5, December 5 2024
